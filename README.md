# DDoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Summary
DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks are a growing threat to online services, causing disruptions by overwhelming networks with malicious traffic. This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate such attacks by analyzing network traffic data. By identifying patterns associated with DDoS attacks, the project helps enhance cybersecurity defenses against these threats.

The project follows a structured approach to data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical labels, and scaling numerical features. Using powerful libraries such as `pandas` and `scikit-learn`, it enables efficient data manipulation and feature engineering. The processed dataset is then used to train machine learning models capable of distinguishing normal traffic from potential DDoS attacks.

By integrating machine learning with network security analysis, this project provides a scalable solution for detecting DDoS attacks in real-time. The approach serves as a foundation for developing advanced threat detection systems, helping organizations safeguard their digital infrastructure against cyber threats.

## Features
The project involves cleaning and preparing a dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical labels, and scaling numerical features. It utilizes `pandas` for data manipulation and `scikit-learn` for preprocessing and model training. The processed data can then be used to train and evaluate machine learning models for DDoS detection.
